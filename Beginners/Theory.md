## Mutable and Immutable Objects

### The Inner Working of Python
 - Whenever we make any variables python assigns a place for that VALUE in the memory and give the reference to the Variable name.

 - And when a variable is reassigned with new value the value gets a new place in memory and now the variable reference new place of memory and the previous one being no reference is taken care by in built garbage collector.

**This is for immutable objects but in mutable object the original value itself gets changed**
- Immutable Objects example: Int, String....
- Mutable Objects: List, Object, Dict, Array, ByteArray..


## Data Types:
